Editorial Note:
There are moments where the interview is interrupted by people entering the office to speak to the interviewee, however these moments have been in the recording for the sake of the recordings flow. These moments will however be left out of the transcription. 

00:00:01
L.R: So, could we start by you introducing yourself again and, you know, explaining what you do here and how you came to be living in Point-Saint-Charles?

P.D.G: My name is Patrick de Gruyter. I work at Saint Columba House in Point-Saint-Charles. I have been working here on and off for three years. Um, and just a few weeks ago I moved into Point-Saint-Charles. I did a degree, I was a mature student at Concordia University. I did a degree there a few years ago and an internship in- three years ago with Saint Columba house and then was offered a position after that. Uh, now I’ve been work and living here and, yea, that’s me. 

L.R: Wow that’s incredible! Do you ever like- how do you just decide, okay, this where I want to be, this is, like, where I want to work. What really made you come here?

P.D.G: Uhmm, well like most of us I don’t really choose where I want to work, most of the time you don’t have that many options and I was lucky to get this option.

00:00:58
L.R: Right

P.D.G: Um, so, It was, uh, something that I wanted to work in an environment such as Saint Columba House after my, after my program, my degree. That I was referred here and that it worked out was, umm. I mean there aren’t that many positions like this. So, I was really lucky. And then when I, uhh, -pause- when I worked here for a little while. I decided or we decided, we wanted to continue and that was a possibility I was taken on full time and then it was, pretty much, the next step was immediately to say, okay, if I live- if I work in this community, I also want to live in it. And so over the last year I have been looking for apartments and because of gentrification that has been more difficult than it used to be, but my wife and I we found something and we live now in reach, so its really good, really nice.

L.R: Awesome, wow, that’s really- 

P.D.G: By foot, by, like, walking ten minutes

L.R: Oh, Wow! 

P.D.G: Yea

00:01:50
L.R: That’s even better! Um, you- you mentioned gentrification what... how, how are you noticing gentrification affecting... uh, Point-Saint-Charles, of course and Saint Columba house?

P.D.G: Well, I mean, on three levels; myself, Saint Columba House, and the Point-Saint-Charles in general. Myself, simply, uh, when I was looking for apartments, I’m still, you know, I still have student debt. So we, neither one of us was making lots of money, uh. Then I realized that a lot of the apartments I found are condos to rent, uh, for like, uh, 1600$ a month, or something like that. That’s not necessarily something I can pay and that’s definitely not something that many people in the traditional community that can pay. Um, for the Point, in general, gentrification has been going for a long time... the most interesting part of that, I find, is that the Point compared to other neighbourhoods has been more resistant to gentrification, I believe. Um but it is so, our reality, we have to deal with it. And specifically for Saint Columba house our greater challenges, I find, right now is to um... integrate... more people, like that come new that don’t belong to what we would call the traditional ‘Pointers’. In our work here we do programming and fill needs that are- by including everyone, but that’s, uh, that’s a challenge enough.

00:03:29
L.R: Right, How do you- how do you envision- um- acclimating these newcomers because I know there is like, a very big difference between what people would call ‘yuppies’ or like ‘new-comers’ or -you know- almost infiltrators to the Point as gentrification -gentrifyers- rather, and like the and the people who have lived here all their lives. How do you think you can bridge that gap?

P.D.G: Well, I disagree with some of you premise

L.R: Yea 

P.D.G: I’m just saying that now, but umm... yea and also just to be clear this has been going for decades. 

L.R: Right

P.D.G: These efforts as well, but, um, we’ve been around for the last three years and also how its affecting me and also how its- I’m thinking about these thing or rather -pause- like... the easiest and the most and the most successful was by simply offering, programming, um, that is accessible to everyone and interesting to everyone and we have a lot of very mixed groups already. So, we’ve been very successful so far. My seniors groups, for example, is very mixed, both when it comes to social economic background, when it comes to, like, uh... just geographic location. Where they were born and where they are now. We have like Dutch people, German people, Guiana, Haiti, so also to- uh, to mix people. um -pause- One of things that we do is that, a lot of our programming is free.

00:05:08
L.R: Right

P.D.G: So it does not cost anything. So my seniors group meets every Friday, men’s group meets tomorrow  (Tuesday) and there is going to be dinner and that does not cost anything. So, accessibility is very, very important, um, that what we do everyone wants because what we do is simply community. Social isolation is not something that can be broken... by money unless you are an organization. 

L.R: Right

P.D.G: That’s a very absolute statement. I’m still trying to figure that out, but I- over the last few months I’ve been going to a lot of meetings and been talking a lot about social isolation and how to break it, uh, because we have more and more socially isolated seniors especially... and it seems its harder for the individual to break social isolation they have a lower economic background because you can’t buy friends. To put it very simple, but if an organization such as ours has money, the funds and resources to, uh, to put out programming and figure out whatever the needs of the community and fill them. Then, independently of this social economic background people will come out, will participate, and will create into they’re own community. For me that’s what it is all about. 

00:06:28
L.R: Right, and how do you think the spirit of community came about because I hear it everywhere with every other interview I’ve done every time I’ve visited here- there is a huge camaraderie and, you know, tight knit group almost- how did that come about, really?

P.D.G: Uh-pause- So the, the narrative that I so far have figured, or like, put together is one that you’ll here pretty much anywhere, but it is, um, a working class neighbourhood. You have both francophone and anglophones, working class living here now and a lot more people than now. We have now 13,000- 14,000 it used to be like 30,000 (note: I believe he meant 3,000) which apparently there is, um, they were working class then until everything was fine, or everything was how it was until about the 50s and 60s when the Lachine canal closed and the Saint Laurence seaways opened, all the industry left. A lot of people left, a lot of people stayed and people had less money because they weren’t working anymore, it was harder to find work, and everyone was working, the men were working in factories and for the railway and the women were working downtown in secretaries or Birks and they took the tram and they’d go to work that was common. Uhm... this radical shift led to, uh... a lot of needs in the community that weren’t filled anymore. For example, medical or healthcare didn’t exist anymore and it was harder and harder. So people got together with students- medical students from McGill and started our community clinic in the late 60s which is now one of our CLSCs in Quebec, uh, and many, many other things so I think what happened was that there was a very radical shift and people realized, uhm... if we want to continue having... dignity in our lives and our quality of lives we have to band together and fight. And fight they did. Uh, and they were very successful, they created a lot of organizations and groups and some of them formal some informal uh... there is a mutual identity thing going one that we have here in the Point. And by doing all of that you come into a neighbourhood which, I believe which that’s my thesis and I have no data to back it up but I still believe there is no other neighbourhood in Canada with that amount of social character on the ground. There is a lot of social character a lot of people that are directly connected, talk to each other. Uh, and for me personally it feels like a small town, and I grew up in a small town, so I feel very much at home. I like nodding at people and saying ‘Bonjour’ when I walk in the street. I like chatting with them on the street and that’s what happens.

00:09:35
L.R: Wow, what- how do you, how do you see the needs of this community- how have they evolved for you? I mean with your experience here what... has been the change that you have seen consistently, especially with Columba house, how have you guys adapted to those different needs and what not? 

P.D.G: Figuring out the needs of the community is one of our priorities and we constantly do that or we try to constantly do that, uhm -pause- We’ve been here for 100 years there are many parts of this history that I do not know and many parts that I know a little bit about and I know that I think one- I think already 100 years ago there was already a little bit of that feeling by the people who founded it. It wasn’t about charity, but rather about justice and I did some research last year and there used to be in the UK, there used to be something called the Settlement House movement, and there are still some of these settlement houses that are around and that was where the more affluent middle class moved into houses like this in low-income or working class neighbourhoods and then, um, tried to essentially live together also figure out how to allocate resources. So, I think over all, that has very often, I’m sure, not happened in Saint Columba house. I’m sure it was very roughly more authoritarian charity approach and I think overall its the spirit that lingers on over the 100 years. That helped, uhm -pause- Something, some needs have changed, and some needs are the same we are in a neighbourhood where people often people have very materialistic needs. Like food and shelter and medical care and education and are not getting what they need, like other people are getting what they need, um.. we try to fill these needs and then the one... and that causes back to the gentrification. Then we can moved on,  but what everyone needs is simply community. And that needs is something that we... constantly try to fill in a different manner because you always have to adapt and figure out what is at need. At the end of the day it is always the same. You know, you try and get people together and engage them or have them engage and then facilitate it and you break social isolation, but you create community. Hopefully with that identity uhm, people take ownership in this house and in their larger community and I think, and its a completely romantic notion of mine, but I am hoping that there was someone like me here 50 years ago, who talked pretty much the same. You know, these are not new ideas or elements and hopefully 50 years from now there is someone like me as well.

At this time the kids came through the hallway and it does get quite noisy with the teacher calming them down. 
00:12:50
L.R: That’s fair. So when you- you mentioned the men groups and the -laughter- 
The kids peeked in and said hello, the noise in the hallways gets louder, we speak at an elevated tone to acclimate.

L.R: The um- 

P.D.G: If you are not , if you are comfortable you can close the door. 
[I close the door. Will leave out the following conversation from transcription as it was not pertinent to the interview]
L.R: So, um, for the senior groups, and what not, what are some discussion topics that you hit upon? Do you have any like, personal stories?

P.D.G: Oh, God yes. I mean lots of stories. I mean I’m very lucky because I am someone that tries to be more activistic, in doing more advocacy work. So every Friday I get to learn from people who have been doing that all their lives. So, for example, uh, one of my participants she told me they went to city hall at some point. I think it was to, about, I think at one point the lowered the speed limit in the Point to 20 miles, at the time, I think they were still counting miles. So they went down- to city hall to demonstrate uhm, and a policeman told her that if she was his wife she wouldn’t be out demonstrating. So, uhm, And now she tells this story to me, uhm, reminding me that I have a lot of responsibility when I go out there and do things, but also with a lot of pride. Its nice to hear these stories because these women- and it was mostly women, they changed a lot here in the Point. At some point they mobilized against the casino that was planned here just 10-12 years ago, uhm, they created a legal support, like a legal clinic, social housing. We still have- in the Point there is 43% - about 40% of our housing is accessible housing. That’s- no one else has that.

00:14:51
L.R: Right, how did you guys fight for that, because that’s incredible. I’ve never heard of that any where else?

P.D.G: They, uh, have been fighting for this, residents of Point-Saint-Charles, for 50 years its simple as that. Like how do you fight for that, its not that, its more the longevity of the fight. That’s the uhm, that seems to be the success.

L.R: Wow! That’s absolutely incredible. And do you find that most of the discussion is based around local issues, or do you guys talk about, international issues as well?

P.D.G: Oh, we do- I mean I also have a political discussion group that meets every Thursday and a lot of my seniors are in that and in my senior group we also talk about climate change and income inequality. We had a couple of – we had an organization which works with prisons and reintegration and this kind of stuff, so last Friday we had prisoners come in and we, um... do story- telling. Like we do... at least twice a year we just do story telling where we take a subject, last time it was winter, or Christmas and everyone tells a story about how it was when they were a child for example. Uh, We share a lot of stories. 

L.R- Wow! So, you have people here, I’m guessing, that have lived here their whole lives in Point-Saint-Charles and can tell you about the Industrial Age?

P.D.G- Absolutely, we have people in their 80s and 90s uh, they’re parents already where born and raised in the Point and they have a lot of knowledge and stories.

[Break: some comes into the office, For privacy’s sake I will exclude this from the transcription.]
00:16:37
L.R: So, how do you find that the younger generation is engaging in this, is it on the same level or?

P.D.G: I have no idea. I seriously have no idea, uhm, I don’t work with youth, I don’t work with kids. Uh, I used to my first community job was with the kids and uh... when we- most of my participants are like 50+ so I don’t know. 

L.R: Okay, but do you think that this type of spirit of activism and um, fighting for community is still going to continue even like after this generation passes on you- I mean there is- I’ve noticed a lot of young volunteers.

P.D.G: Absolutely

L.R: Do they come mostly from here or do they come from universities?

P.D.G: There is a lot of university students here there is also people who are from the Point who are volunteering here um, there’s a lot of people who come in- young people as well who are like 3rd generation kind of Saint Columba house people you know, their grandmother volunteers in the kitchen already and the father came for lunch. Um, when it comes to political mobilization, uh, I don’t see that many young people, but I see enough, you know I see some. There could be more, you know, always. 

00:18:07
L.R: Awesome and this connection between Saint Columba house and the universities how did it come about? I know you spoke about the- McGill coming into with the clinics and what not, how did it really strengthen?

P.D.G: I think um, I mean there are many thoughts to say about that, but I think there is a long history of Saint Columba working with universities, students, and professors and um, there is, of course, a research interest, we have been here for 100 years so, we can offer a lot of things that others can’t. Like I helped one of your colleagues find interviews as well and all this. Um, we have interns, they don’t cost money.

L.R: [chuckles] The best kind of labour.

P.D.G: I was asked-  I have an intern right now who is great and I usually don’t have student interns because I don’t want to exploit people, its as simple as that. I don’t like the student internship that is unpaid, but our reality is that we have a lot of interns and they do great, great, great work, but they are not getting paid.

L.R: Yea, and where do- if you don’t mind me asking where do most of you funds come from? Do you have organizations coming in and providing donation or do you have personal donations, like what is- how-?

P.D.G: We have a budget of around 700,000$ a month- not a month a year. Of that the United Church of Canada which is-  which we are affiliated with, we are a community ministry of the United Church, its about 25% and the rest are donors from all levels of government, private foundations, so I mean private foundations, private individuals and that’s just the money. And then the rest we also have donations of food and all sorts of materials that we have every year and then, of course, we have donations of time, our volunteers.

00:20:07
L.R: So, do you work very closely with the local government are they involved in positive way?

P.D.G: Yeah, I mean we know our city council very well, we know our ‘conseiller d’arrondissement’ (translated: means neighbourhood/borough councillor) uh, they come, right now they don’t come as often as they used to because they won the election so many of them are in different positions now in local government, in the Montreal government, but yea we work closely, we try to work closely with all levels of government, so the city level-  like on the ‘arrondissement’ (neighbourhood or borough) level, on the city level, on the provincial level, and on the federal level. 

L.R: What do you think is the biggest need right now for the community? Like what do needs- what’s an issue that really needs to be addressed other than gentrification?

P.D.G: Oh, the biggest- I mean the biggest issue that every community has is income inequality and climate change so, uh, there are of course gentrification and housing and food security and all these things, but the overwhelming 2 things that are looming are the same for everyone. 

00:21:20
L.R: Right, and how do you guys address that here because I’ve heard about the beehives which is really cool.

P.D.G: Oh, yeah, I mean the beehives won’t help us much with climate change, but at least we’re creating awareness in general for the environment, we’ve been doing that for a long time.  Uhm, we talk about it a lot in our seniors group, we talk a lot about climate change in our political discussion group. We’re working on an open letter to the government right now in order to help promote public transport like here in Montreal. Um... but yea its difficult income inequality and climate change are really big things, but they affect everyone. You do something you don’t see great effect immediately because there a big global things. Uh so for me and for us, I guess- I mean me personally, I’m a good constructionist. I just want to get people talking about it and getting ideas about it. There is already a lot of that obviously going on, but just to create these ideas and engage people with the reality and then hopefully something will come out of it, but its better than not taking about it. 

L.R: What have you heard from your senior group about environmental change and all of that? What’s the line of discussion?

P.D.G- Oh there is a lot of- I mean they are not a homogeneous group of course, but they are devastated and not only climate change, but I mean uhm, just a few weeks ago we always have a- we call it an afternoon with, we have it usually once a month. When one of our participants animates and facilitates a program and decides what we do and so to have documentaries shown which was about plastic in the water. Uhm we talked- yea- so people are devastated, but also they immediately say, what can we do, and there is immediately a ‘so what can we do about this’. Uhm, but when we had a big workshop on climate change last year when we were talking about the structural reasons for climate change and how hard it is, but also how, you know how there is no good leadership in the world and we are not doing enough in general and that’s a very depressing thought. Especially- I mean it can be especially if you are 75 and have been an activist all your life and it also included the environment and you can see all this- you know still, we’re burning so much carbon, constantly changing our climate and the recycling doesn’t really help too much. So that’s a depressing thing sometimes.

L.R: That’s- yea that’s especially touching. Do you have people who have lived here all their lives telling you stories about smog and how it was back in the day with the industrial age?

P.D.G: No, actually I should ask that’s a good call. I have a few people who actually could tell me about that, but so far no I haven’t heard any stories about that. I mean, other things like we used to have a tram uh, so uh, I wonder how that would affect and how many cars we had. I mean, I have a couple of people who were like born in the late 20s, uh, in the 30s, but no I should ask them about that.

00:24:31
L.R: Wow, that’s really cool. Um, what for you is something that you- if you could send out a message to the youth of Point-Saint-Charles what would for you would be the message?

P.D.G: Oh... I don’t know I find today’s youth pretty good. I mean for me... like I have somethings in common with someone who is 22 because I just finished my university degree. Before that I essentially just travelled the world and I had lots of different jobs, but I didn’t think of my career um, so even though I’m in my 40s I’m in a situation where I have this job and I am trying to prepare for my retirement, but I have a lot less time. Um, and I hear from a lot of young people that things like retirement fund and these kind of things aren’t- well people are afraid of the future. To put it bluntly, I mean so am I, but simply a lot of people are afraid of the future because we see that it is not going in a direction that benefits a lot of us. Um, so I think on a conceptual level I’m pretty happy with today’s youth. There is a lot of overlap, I wouldn’t dare to speak to activism and how – what to do. Everyone can figure that out themselves and I’m not the guy to tell people what to do. 

00:26:09
L.R: Right. That’s fair. Outside of the house what is another place that really speaks to you in Point-Saint-Charles, maybe that you have a personal connection with or stories with?

P.D.G: Uhm... I really like the.. city renovated part of the train tracks which is at the north east end of the Point, um. Where I live I don’t hear the trains much, which is nice because you know they can get really loud, but when I walk a like bit I get to these train track and they are elevated and they put a bench there um, and you can see down town from there, there’s like a train yard right in front of you. It’s a really beautiful sight. So like I’ve- because for me again like I prefer-  I guess I really enjoy having the small town feel right now because I’ve lived in big cities for the last 20 years, but before that always in small towns. So I have this small town feeling when I sit there and I see this huge, you know, the sky scrappers and the train yards and I know I’m in Montreal which I also love. Um, and its a beautiful and big, vibrant city, but I like Point-Saint-Charles because it like 30,000 people. The way geographically uh, prescribed by like train, highway and canal you know, its- right now that is one of my favourite spots.  

00:27:38
L.R: Wow, and I hear the accent in your voice and my father himself is German.

P.D.G: I can tell.

L.R: Yeah, the name right? Uhm, how did you come to be in Montreal? 

P.D.G: Uhm, well in a- I grew up in Germany. My first career in German I worked for a newspaper like as an editor for a local newspaper and then uhm, I went to university after that, did not like it at all, for like one semester. I mean I liked it, but uhm, I was like ‘no this is not for me’. Packed my backpack and just started to travel. I’ve always been a traveller and then I just hey, you know I saved some money and just started travelling. Ended up in Paris for a year and worked there, ended up in Amsterdam and worked there uhm, kept traveling met a woman from Canada uh, who is now my wife and that was 20 years ago so we celebrated 20 years this year and then we travelled- 

00:28:31
L.R: Congratulations!

P.D.G: Thank you! Then we travelled together and looked in like Vancouver and Toronto... and everywhere in Vienna and all sorts of things. Uh, but she is from Montreal and a few years ago we decided to go to university and uh, Montreal is accessible and affordable when it comes to education. I don’t know are you a Quebecer?

L.R: Um, no I’m a French uh, citizen,  but I came here and ‘the discount’ was there and I was thrilled so...

P.D.G: Yea, so that’s like for us we were like in Montreal and she studied engineering and I studied political science and community and it was possible to do this year because we both counted as Quebecers and so we paid very like, relatively low tuition.

00:29:14
L.R: What attracted you to your major and what not?

P.D.G: I was interested in political theory but specifically a few years ago I read a lot of cognitive sciences which I also found interesting and I think had there been like a program in cognitive sciences I might have done a double major in that- but I started, but I did poli-sci because I was interested in it. But then I did a double major in community affairs and there the interest was clear. I just met someone who introduced me to this school that Concordia has called the School of Community and Public Affairs and I did my major there and what attracted me was the community there too. It’s a school by itself, very close knit community you know your teachers, you know your fellow students. Uh, so, and I’d been interested in community all my life and I’ve been, I’d say involved in community work all my life so that was perfect.

00:30:24
L.R: Wow, awesome, and what have been some of the lessons that you’ve really learned from this place in Point Saint Charles, in general?

P.D.G: Umm. It takes sometimes a long time to build a relationship of trust with someone but it’s totally worth it. But it takes like, like long term approaches are what is needed and so, for example what I’m talking about is the students we helped before like I love my interns, I love our interns but usually they’re only here for about 3 or 4 months. And if I have a new intern in one of my programs, like the, uh, Meals-On-Wheels program. The Meals-On-Wheels program, my best-case scenario is a volunteer or a staff member who’s gonna be here for like 5 years. Like, really getting to know people, bringing them food, and breaking the social isolation by chatting and everything. So this- the long term thing is something that I’m more understood, or can comprehend now. Um, I learned that with the support of my colleagues and the my participants, um, it’s much easier to go out into any kind of public situation than alone. It’s really nice to, like I’ve been doing a little bit more of this recently and I don’t necessarily enjoy it but I know it’s necessary. And it’s really really really nice to have the support because without it I wouldn’t be able to do it. I’ve learnt how to good that is for me. Yup. 

00:32:00
L.R: Wow, and um, the interns that you keep speaking about. The interns and all that, how like are you guys, how do you advertise that, how is it brought forth?

P.D.G: Oh, uh we have um, we work with certain programs at certain universities pretty closely together, I didn’t even look for any interns this time [in-distinctive commentary], one of my interns is not an intern in a- he’s not a university student, he is um, he had an accident and he’s in, essentially, like physical rehabilitation and he needs to get back into the work environment. But then yeah we just work with very specific uh, there’s like um, at college LaSalle there’s a Social Work program then we have McGill Social Work, Concordia, uh, um, what did I have? I had… Urban Planning people. So we work with these but like, often they’ll also just approach, by like how I got my internship, I started like this. Um, I was looking for an internship as part of my program I got to look for whatever I wanted to. I got referred by a friend and here I am. You know, so that happens

00:33:08
L.R: Wow, awesome, and um…

P.D.G: We also have, always, there’s always students who intern here and then stay here as volunteers for example. Like, a lot of people- the House is a, you know, it acts on any one, on everyone a little differently but a lot of people just- Like, I just fell in love with it too, eh. I really did. Like, uh-

00:33:45
L.R: What was that moment for you?

P.D.G: Oh it was just like, I mean after, uh I think it was my first summer. It was during my summer job slash internship because it was, I mean I was paid so it, but. And then I was here for a few weeks and they essentially left me alone here for a few weeks because everyone left on vacation. Um and I mean, I had the key and there wasn’t a lot of people, it was like in August when schools are closed and everything. Um, so I was given a lot of, kind of, in my view at least, a lot of responsibility even though nothing happens in August three years ago. Now it does because we’re open in August, but so I kind of had that time to be almost alone in the House, and do things that were important for the House. But so I had a little time to bond with the place, just on that level. Which is always nice, you know, and it’s just this feeling when, that I have when I, uh, was it last night, uh, Sunday night when we had our Refugee Dinner. We do that once a month, and so we’re done and we say goodbye and we clean up. It was like 7:30 and everyone was already gone, and then I go through the House just to check that all the doors are locked. And you know it’s nice, you know, it’s quiet, it’s dark, you’re- the event is over and you’re just, uh, you’re just- it’s a nice house.

00:35:07
L.R: How do you, because I keep hearing like Refugee programs, you have a senior group, Meals-on-Wheels, how did you find out about these needs and who came up with them, really?

P.D.G: Umm… not a single answer to those. Very often, simply, like Meals-on-Wheels is a good story because we’ve been doing lunch here, for I’m assuming 100 years, like I’m assuming there- like since the depression there’s been a- I’m assuming, uninterrupted daily lunch program. And at some point, decades ago, maybe 15, 20 years ago, um, people started and I’m sure 50 years ago already, people started saying, “Hey my friend Mary she can’t, uh, leave her house anymore but she needs food so why don’t I just- I come here for lunch anyway. I eat some and I’ll take some out for her, I’ll take some home for her.” That’s why Meals-on-Wheels is called Take-Out, like, colloquially. You know in our language we still call it Take Out because it wasn’t us delivering, it was just participants from the community who came for lunch and then brought their family and their friends food. Um, so there the need wasn’t even- it was clear and volunteers started and then someone from the community realized there was a big need there. There is more need there, we work with the team, work with social workers there, and then if they got okay, then we need to do more of this. And then very often what happens is you professionalize it. And that’s Me. And so we have, so yeah that’s one of the examples. Seniors… simple. There is no English Language programming for Seniors in the Point, uh, they started it, it was a success. How did you find success, every Friday there is people showing up. You know, we don’t count, I mean sometimes sure we’re happy if there’s more. Whether it’s 5 or 15, who cares, you know, there’s people coming so yeah. Sometimes it’s very simple. 

00:37.04
L.R: How do you guys choose your topics for discussion in the Senior group? Do they just come, ready to like bustle with stories. Or do you have, like, a set topic every week?

P.D.G: Um, we, I mean, we, the programming comes both from the participants and from outside information. Sometimes things get suggested from the outside, like an organization approaches ‘em. But otherwise the seniors always, like, we always, every couple of months we talk about “what do you want to do” and then I facilitate it so uh best case scenario is that because it’s all about empowerment as well and empowering is when someone tells you lets do that and then you actually do it. So, that’s how we try to do most of our programming. But I’m also like, because I’m also part of the group and I have my interests and I sometimes will be like “Oh that would be nice for the group” and then I just, I just facilitate, I create something I organize something. But we talk about programming and they have ideas and then I try to realize them and then as I said we have the afternoons with where we just, essentially just have an afternoon where they can do whatever they want.

L.R: Wow, okay, that’s-

P.D.G: and Political discussion group we always have every Thursday morning we meet. Uh, and there in the beginning of the group, we decide the, uh, the 3 topics that we’re gonna talk about. Usually it’s something from the headlines. Like, uh, like what’s in the news today, you know we mention 5 topics and we choose three and then we have an hour, an hour fifteen minutes to talk about it. 

00:38:31
L.R: Who makes up the political discussion group? Is it, again, like more of the older generation or do you get like uh..

P.D.G: We get uh- the CoFounder was uh, a younger man Felix who’s not here anymore because he lives with his sister now, uh, far away. Uh we have uh a few younger ones uh but I would say that 40+ 45+, uh a few younger ones, uh lots in their 40s and 50s and a few seniors as well. So a good mix, I would say

L.R: Wow that’s awesome. And do you guys find that it’s leaning on any sort of point in the political spectrum or is it kind of evenly distributed? Do you have more conservatives?

P.D.G: Oh, uh, we have like, it depends on what subject. But uh, I’d say we were like mostly uh, moderate to left with one exception- we also, uh, have a very very good man, uh, who’s also a very solid trump supporter. So that’s always good…

00:39:35
L.R: Okay so it gives a lot of variety into the discussion. Do you guys debate a lot of- or talk about a lot of, uh, American issues or is it mainly Canadian?

P.D.G: Uh, everything, like uh, local Montreal issues, Canadian issues, U.S a lot- International issues. Like, really everything, anything that’s in the news right now like we talked about. Uh, from parking in the Point or, uh, to, uh, Valet de Plant(?), uh Taxes, to Trump, to Trudeau going to India- did we talk about that? No we didn’t talk about Trudeau going to India… but yeah, could be anything, whatever is in the news really, like the entire group is very well read. They read a lot of news papers, and watch news and everything, so we always have something to talk about and it really depends on what’s happening that week right now.

00:40:23
L.R: And you mentioned there’s a lot of different immigrants from all over like Africa, Europe, the States and all that- what do you find what each particular group brings to the Point? What do they- how do they add to the culture?

P.D.G: Our groups are- This is the good thing about Saint Columba House, uh, and like the programs that I facilitate- they’re so- usually small enough like under 20 people, where it’s really all about the individual and not about where they’re coming from. I mean, that also like, because people share they’re stories and everything, so variety, diversity by definition is brought to the- I have a gentleman from Palestine who tells stories about growing up in Palestine you know, but it’s really about the individual more than their background or where they’re coming from. But that’s important, it’s, it’s the individual than the group itself that’s more, like, I think it’s like trying to focus on the individual and whatever group it is that you’re facilitating right now. 

00:41:25
L.R: Right, so back in the day I heard, you hear about, like, the divide with the railroad between the two languages French and English. Do you find that now a days it’s more of like a, like it’s more French than English, how is that addressed here?

P.D.G: Well I think, numbers wise, from what I understand, there are fewer Anglophones in now but more Allophones here now. Uh so, short answer is, we’re waiting for the census to come out because right now we have a census that’s being published right now so will be interesting to see. My lived experiences definitely we have a lot more Allophones here, immigrants, migrants, um, and we are doing more, uh, what we call intercultural work, um so we’re doing that. Whether it’s our refugee group or in our coffee shop we have like specific programs for that, uh, we work closely together with our local mosque for example. There’s another thing that I’d like to target because I know from other studies that have been done that there are a lot of Allophones in there so I’d like to target that a little more. Yeah we’ll see, it’s a constant uh, uh like a constant desire for us to um, to want to get in, to find relationships with anyone who lives around here but it’s, don’t forget it’s not only- The community, it’s changed. 100 years ago geography was a lot more important. Burt and Russell wrote in 1930 already about the connect between the car and community. Because now mobility is a thing. Like, I have a people who come from Lachine, well he doesn’t- well, like he takes the metro, the bus, or from- from all sorts of- they just come in not just because they’re from the Point but they come in because they like more people, or they like what they can do here. So, so it’s a different situation. 

00:43:29
L.R: Okay, well that kind of addresses my next question, do you guys solely work within the community or do you have people coming from the outside? Um- but do you have people coming in, you know, kind of saying “Well how could I be a part of these services?”

P.D.G: Oh yeah, yeah sure we have like, we have- I mean, we don’t because we are, we’re not keeping track of people. We don’t have lists. We don’t take names, we don’t take surnames, we don’t ask when were you born, where do you live, all this kind of stuff. Uh but yeah we have lots of people who come here just because they like Saint Columba House, and they don’t- like I’m assuming, 50-60 years ago, the vast vast majority of participants here lived very close by. And that has changed a little bit at least. Yeah definitely.

00:44:26
L.R: And I’m going to ask you this because I know they’re building another condo right next door- how do you guys feel about that and how is that, like, going to affect you?

P.D.G: Well, I mean, this directly, serves as a good reminder of- we don’t need more condos in the Point, simple as that but we will have more condos in the Point. And in these condos will live people, real people, with their needs and their stories. And uh, and some of them will be socially isolated and they will have, uh, a need of community, so what does that mean for us and how do we make that happen.

00:45:05
L.R: What about services in the Point? I’ve noticed, I’ve had this said before that Point Saint Charles is kind of a desert when it comes to services and businesses. How do, do you guys kind address that here?

P.D.G: Well I mean, there are parts of the Point that are food deserts, very clearly, for example, one of the things we do is have a Meals on Wheels program to deliver food to these areas. There are other, I mean others- we have one bank in the Point and it’s Desjardins, so it’s the Quebec co-op bank. We have a Dollarama, these aren’t necessarily bad things. When it comes to services- uh, I mean food security is a big thing for us, having affordable, nutritious food here every day for lunch is really really important. We give out- I mean, ours cost 2 dollars, 1:50 if you buy for the month and we give a lot of food as well. That’s definitely one way, there are other services, I mean we have our clinic- we work very closely with them. The Point is not a poor area, that’s important to understand. And people here are not poor, it is traditionally working class area, like some of my seniors when they hear the word poor they don’t like that. They like- what they say is “maybe a little rough, maybe a little tough but never poor.” Because everyone always worked for a living, and still does. So and me now, as someone who lives here, it’s good living. 

00:46:50
L.R: But are there more- Is there a need for more local businesses in this neighborhood?

P.D.G: Depends what they bring with them, eh? Uh, yeah depends on what they bring with them. Uh, you can see already, certain businesses like on center street that are more, uh, targeting people with more money, uh, eh, affordable food is always good. If there were more grocery stores that would be nice, more grocery stores, more banks.. uh access to banks, uh.. but we’ll see, like I’m assuming like 5 years from now like the streets- like Center street and even Rellings street there will be a lot more gentrified businesses popping up. Uh we already have that- like it’s interesting like Batiment Sept, for example, they’re doing so much. They’re kind of filling both needs, like there’s uh, there’s gonna be an art school and a bike shop and all this but then there is also gonna be a bar. You know. So, uh, like a micro brewery. So yeah.

[ Brief Pause ]

00:48:12
L.R: And Batiment Sept, do you think it’s gonna work? Do you think you could possibly have anything business driven classes going on here that could help promote that? You know helping that out?

P.D.G: I’m sorry, I don’t understand.

L.R: So with Batiment Sept coming about soon, I mean I’m not quite sure when that’s going to be realized-

P.D.G: In May

L.R: In May? Oh wow

P.D.G: Yeah the first phase starts in May. Yup. Like their grocery store, I think the bike store, the art school, couple of other things they open in May, yup. The bar as well, yeah. 

L.R: Do you notice a need at all in the neighborhood at all to like maybe learn business classes or-

P.D.G: Business classes? Why business classes?

L.R: Yeah like, sort of like, starting up your own business or anything like that-

P.D.G: No body has ever come to me and asked about that, nope

00:49:12

L.R: Out of curiosity and uh- what’s maybe the program that you’re the most proud of, kind of like, your baby, something that you really, like-

P.D.G: Umm.. I guess the Political Discussion group because I started with like a couple of people together and I really like that. It’s a good group, I’ve learned a lot there.

L.R: Awesome and how many members do you have there?

P.D.G: It’s an open, casual group there. So we can have right now we usually have 10-12 people coming every Thursday morning. But it could be anything- in the beginning it was like 3-4 sometimes 2. Sometimes it can be 15, you know

L.R: Do you guys sometimes get lost in conversation? Lose time sometimes?

P.D.G: Well we always have a facilitator, we don’t have many rules but we have a few rules- and then I think we’re pretty good by saying “okay we’re done with this now, lets move on” because as I said, we always choose 3 subjects and we want to cover all those 3 subjects. So no we’re pretty like, we’re- like the idea is to deliberate rather than debate so uh and you know sometimes it works sometimes it doesn’t.

00:50:07
L.R:  What are the rules regarding that uh-

P.D.G: Oh we, um, yeah we choose before we uh- we choose our subjects- that every week we have someone else facilitating- the facilitator essentially has the power to say “okay you talk now” and someone hasn’t talked in a while they should be given preference for when they put up their hand- these kinds of things. So very simple rules but they seem to work in that small group rather well. Sometimes they don’t, sometimes people keep talking and it’s a fun group and it’s like- since everyone gets to facilitate, everyone has a different style so yeah but it’s a good group.

00:50:48
L.R: Awesome- and you mention a story telling group, what kind of stories do they tell?

P.D.G: Oh we don’t have a story telling group but we use story telling in all our groups always. Like, in my seniors group, uh and then we, like in our senior group, twice a year just a story telling event where we just say “okay we take a subject like Christmas for example, or summer vacation and then very often we share stories from our childhood. Like how it was growing up in summer, how did you spend your summer vacation. The other thing that we’re also doing is when we’re going to our Meals-On-Wheels participants it’s a holistic approach, we’re not only bringing food but also trying to break social isolation. And their stories are very important so when we have the time, and when the participant is in the mood, we uh, chat a little bit and very often we get told stories. Uh, and that’s very nice and a very very good part of our- and from time to time I write them down and I notarize them, I put them on Facebook- but it’s a very oral tradition, like they tell me stories sometimes when I have the time I write them down but usually I just tell them to someone else so they’re just living up here.

00:52:00
L.R: Wow that’s awesome. How, like, how long does each stop normally take. Do you guys like limit them or-

P.D.G: Well, uh the first rule of our very few rules of our Meals-on-Wheels is don’t be in a rush. You never know when, sometimes you come and someone is tired and not feeling so well and sometimes they want to chat a little bit- sometimes you only stay there for a minute and sometimes you stay there for an hour. 

L.R: Wow, so with regards to this, I mean, my class came in and kind of disrupted everything- and told you, okay, you know, like these are projects that are gonna happen. What is kind of your hope- what do you hope will come out of these projects? What are you- what would you like to come from these projects?

P.D.G: Uhh it’s difficult to say. For me, uh, I try to participate with as many academic projects as possible. Uh, very rarely do I have academic expectations. I just trust you guys, uh, and then hope that you will find something of value and uh, I mean, best case scenario is that I also gain something of value but you know it’s your, this is what you do, your approach and your work. This is your work that you do. So I, uh, we just try to be helpful. In my case I just think, some- it’s important to do this. 

00:53:34
L.R: And uh are there any other stories you really wanna share, or that you really want to say about Saint Columba House or Point Saint Charles?

P.D.G: There are so many- I think you got the most important ones. But there is, uh, I was just thinking about this. Uh, I’m trying to organize, I’m had this idea to organize a kind of station for my seniors where we would invite maybe retired workers from the railroad, like maybe from the union and get them here and just talk about the railroad. Like 50 years ago, and what that meant for the Pointe and all this kind of stuff. And then I have these ideas and I’ve done similar things in the past already with incredibly awesome stories that were being told and shared. And I always think, because I used to be a journalist and still have that “oh I need to record this and there needs to be a chronic of this” you know? Um and I’m really, really that’s my story for the day is that I’m really happy that I’m getting more comfortable with letting these stories just be a story in the air and not recording them, not feeling that pressure to- just telling them and listening to them and then maybe I’ll share that story in 10 years and maybe some of these stories will die, you know with the- but it’s really nice to be apart of this. It feels like any story being told I become a part of, because I carry it around with me and that’s very nice. 

00:55:14

L.R: That’s awesome. Do you feel that, I mean obviously oral history is- just from what you’ve told me- is a huge huge thing in the Point, do you- how do you think a lot of the older generation feel about the closing of the factories and what do you think could, do you think that they want them to become anything? Like, should they just sit there? Like, what’s your-

P.D.G: The factories?

L.R: Yeah the factories

P.D.G: Well, I mean, most of these buildings are already spoken for it’s done. That’s already done. Uh, I, we don’t have much property left in the Pointe that is up for grabs. I think there is some people that I know who, yeah, have problems with change- but we all have problems with change. But yeah, that ship has sailed.

00:56:24
L.R: Do you almost wish that one of them had been kept as a sort of- because in class we’ve kicked around the idea that what if these were changed into like museums and like, really highlighting the history and what not. Do you think that would have been like-?

P.D.G: Well that’s the nice thing about Batiment Sept, you know the way that they take like an old factory building and like you know literally take the means of production and giving them back to the community. That’s definitely very nice. At the end of the day, most people are way more pragmatic than that, they say “okay there’s a building can I live there?” Can we make accessible apartments there? I’ve heard a lot of people- like finding a place to live is a huge priority for a lot of people and I’ve heard many people ask me for “hey do you know where I can find a place to live” I’ve never had anyone ask me for a museum. Like that’s not usually what people ask for. 

00:57:32
L.R: Yeah that’s not a typical thing here in the Point, right? And co-op housing, you’ve mentioned it before, how- what’s the- what are the, again I’ve heard that demographic wise you’ll have people coming in and building up these condos and they target a specific demographic. What demographic do you think is usually the one most left out?

P.D.G: Most left out are people who don’t qualify for housing assistance provided by the governments. So we just had a situation where two houses, two buildings in the Pointe were condemned. And the people- the city evicted the people in the houses, took care of them to a certain degree but if you don’t qualify for assistance and you still don’t have any money and you don’t know anyone- that’s a problem. If you don’t have papers, if you’re a refugee, if you’re illegal in the country, if you’re dealing with health problems, like severe health problems. Uh, it’s always hard to say what’s the most vulnerable group. It’s much easier for me to think about all the people that I see everyday and think okay so who’s the most vulnerable individual that I know of right now. I like that about my job because I like to do that, I get to be qualitative here, I don’t have to be quantitative. I am quantitative a little bit but I can remain- like the human factors are a reality more than numbers. 

00:59:00
L.R: Alright, wow, um, I mean, I’m really curious about the personal stories but do you have any at all that you could share?

P.D.G: A personal story?

L.R: Yeah absolutely, with the one on one with the Meals-on-Wheels, cause you keep talking about it and there’s a twinkle in your eye when you talk about it

P.D.G: Ah, yes, of course, well I have one participant- and I know I can share this story, that’s why I’m sharing it. She grew up, she’s 91 now, and um she’s one of the best story tellers that I know. And she grew up in a small town in uh, border of New Brunswick and Quebec. And her- in a village on a river, and her dad and her mom they made her go do chores for old people. And they were poor, like these were really poor people. Everyone was poor there. And they would fish in the river but it wasn’t allowed. You know, like these kinds of things, and so she already had her own chores, you know, helping in the garden, and doing this. But her parents would, would as well, go and help- there was an elderly couple and so the girl would have to go there and the sons to help them. And she was really pissed, she was like “Dad why do make me go- like I already have so much work to do, why do you make me go and help these people?” and of course she tells me this story because now we come there and bring her food and we help her and so that’s- I like that story. 

L.R: That’s awesome. Well if you don’t have anything else to say, then I can conclude the interview. Awesome-

Session 1/1
