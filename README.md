## What is _These Walls CAN talk?_

The project started as an idea to promote voices of Montreal's borough Point Saint Charles, and get people interested in this impoverished community. Point Saint Charles has a very involved community, and we wanted to spotlight it in a far reaching format while still making it feel interactive and allow for discussion.

## Mission Statement

Our Mission is to highlight stories and expeirences from Point Saint Charles residents. We want to make the voices of the community heard by giving them a platform to interact with the public and start a discourse for important issues.


### _A Bit on Point Saint Charles_

> Point Saint Charles is a neighbourhood in the city of Montreal. Historically it was a very working class area, and was a booming site of industry through its strategic location beside the Lachine Canal. This, coupled with traintracks running right through the borough made "The Point" a relatively stable neighbourhood until the 1960s, when the canal was closed in favour of the St. Lawrence Seaway. The neighbourhood slowly declined with frequent layoffs and little employment opportunity, but The Point has been a poster child for community solidarity by forming outreach programs and community organizations. Today, Point Saint Charles is still an impoverished area, but is slowly getting back on its feet with a solid foundation in community involvement.



## What You Can Expect

Our goal is to hear from you! Various stories from the community will be presented here for your viewing, so you can see _Point Saint Charles_ from different walks of life. Interested in getting your story on the site? Let us know at @thesewallscantalk@outlook.com

### Point Saint Charles Spotlight #1: Shaen Johnston

Shaen Johnston ended up in the Point quite by accident, but she's been in love with it ever since! In her seven years in the point she was fiercely active in the community, fought for social housing and community outreach programs, and to this day is immensely proud of her adopted community. She told us her story during a walk around the point, showing us some hidden gems in the point and some places that could use some support and awareness. Follow our walk with the map below, each colour indicates a different part of the interview.
