### Point Saint Charles Spotlight #1: Shaen Johnston

Shaen Johnston ended up in the Point quite by accident, but she's been in love with it ever since! In her seven years in the point she was fiercely active in the community, fought for social housing and community outreach programs, and to this day is immensely proud of her adopted community. She told us her story during a walk around the point, showing us some hidden gems in the point and some places that could use some support and awareness. Follow our walk with the map below, each colour indicates a different part of the interview.
